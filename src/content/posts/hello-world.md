# Hello World

This is your first post. It verifies that the Markdown pipeline, routing, and UI components work as expected.

- Uses frontmatter for metadata
- Renders markdown content
- Will be used to test TOC, syntax highlighting, and reading time

```ts
export function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```
